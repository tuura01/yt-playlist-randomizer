# Yt-playlist-randomizer
Randomize youtube playlists. The shuffle implemented by youtube doesn't "work properly". The shuffle loops videos in chunks, stop shuffling & seems to have some sort of bias on which videos to play first.

### Running

run using the `npm start` command, make sure you have npm installed. <br>
Or click the link for a live version: https://tuura01.github.io/yt-playlist-randomizer <br><br>
in the field `playlist id` add your playlist id. Youtube url should look something like this:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
where you enter the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX part into the playlist id field.
